Exercise 4:
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you
donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26
because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

Script checking what divisors input int have and print them out in a list.
